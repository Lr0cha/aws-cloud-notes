  üê≥ AWS Containers: ECR, ECS & Fargate
</h1>

AWS offers fully managed services to build, store, and run containers at scale without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

    Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry)</h3>
</div>

Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a **fully managed container registry** service that makes it easy to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images, and OCI-compliant artifacts. 

> [!NOTE]\
> Think of ECR as **"Docker Hub, but managed inside AWS"**.

### üîë Key Features and Concepts

* **Secure Storage**: ECR is integrated with [AWS IAM](./04-aws-iam.md), controlling who can access your container repositories. It also supports encryption at rest using AWS Key Management Service (KMS).

* **Image Scanning**: Amazon ECR performs **automated vulnerability scanning** of container images when they are **pushed** to the registry.

* **Highly Available & Scalable**

* **Seamless Integration**: Amazon ECR integrates seamlessly with services like Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), and AWS Fargate.

* **Repositories**
  Amazon ECR repositories are containers for your images, and they support both **public** and **private** repositories. 

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> Amazon ECR uses AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to enable resource-based permissions for private Docker repositories to push, pull, and manage images through CLI.

* **Lifecycle Policies**
  ECR supports **lifecycle policies**, allowing you to automate the **cleanup** of unused or old images, helping to manage storage costs and maintain the health of your registry.

* **Version Control**

> \[!IMPORTANT]
> When using the **AWS CLI** with Amazon ECR, ensure you're using the latest version of the CLI to access all the latest features, including new image scanning capabilities and repository management functions.

    Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)</h3>
</div>

Amazon ECS is a **fully managed, highly scalable container orchestration service** that allows you to run and manage Docker containers on AWS. 


### üîë Key Features and Concepts

- **Clusters** ‚Äì Logical groups where tasks and services run. 
  - Backed either by **EC2 instances** (that you manage) or **AWS Fargate** (serverless).

- **Task Definitions** ‚Äì JSON blueprints that define:
  - Which container images to run (from ECR, Docker Hub, etc.)
  - CPU and memory requirements
  - Networking mode
  - Environment variables and IAM roles
  - Data volumes

- **Tasks** ‚Äì Running instances of a task definition (i.e., containers in action).

- **Services** ‚Äì Ensure that a **specified number of tasks** are always running. 
  - Can integrate with **Load Balancers (ALB/NLB)** for traffic distribution. 
  - Supports **auto scaling** based on demand.

### üöÄ Launch Types

ECS supports two primary launch types:

1. **ECS on EC2**
   - You provision and manage EC2 instances to serve as container hosts. 
   - Provides full control over instance types, AMIs, networking, and scaling. 
   - Best when you need **fine-grained control** over infrastructure or want to use **Reserved Instances/Spot** for cost optimization.

2. **ECS on Fargate**
   - Serverless compute: AWS manages the underlying infrastructure. 
   - No need to manage EC2 instances, scaling, or patching. 
   - You only define the **task definition** (what to run) and ECS + Fargate take care of **where to run it**. 
   - Best for teams that want **simplicity**.

<div>
  <h3>
    <img src="../assets/fargate.png" alt="AWS FARGATE" width="25px"/>
    AWS Fargate</h3>
</div>

Fargate is a **serverless compute engine for containers**.

- **No infrastructure management** ‚Äì You don‚Äôt need to provision or scale EC2 instances.
- **Pay-per-use** ‚Äì Billed per vCPU and memory usage per second.
- **Security isolation** ‚Äì Each task runs in its own kernel-level isolation.
- **Integration** ‚Äì Works with ECS and EKS.

> [!NOTE]\
> With Fargate, you only define **"what to run"**, not **"where to run"**.

---

##  Common Example

1. Build a Docker image and **push to ECR**. 
2. Define an ECS **Task Definition** pointing to the image. 
3. Run it in ECS using either **EC2** or **Fargate**. 
4. Optionally expose via an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.
